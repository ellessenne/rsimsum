#' @title Example of a simulation study on missing data
#' @description A dataset from a simulation study comparing different ways to handle missing covariates when fitting a Cox model (White and Royston, 2009).
#' One thousand datasets were simulated, each containing normally distributed covariates \eqn{x} and \eqn{z} and time-to-event outcome.
#' Both covariates have 20\% of their values deleted independently of all other variables so the data became missing completely at random (Little and Rubin, 2002).
#' Each simulated dataset was analysed in three ways.
#' A Cox model was fit to the complete cases (`CC`).
#' Then two methods of multiple imputation using chained equations (van Buuren, Boshuizen, and Knook, 1999) were used.
#' The `MI_LOGT` method multiply imputes the missing values of \eqn{x} and \eqn{z} with the outcome included as \eqn{\log (t)} and \eqn{d}, where \eqn{t} is the survival time and \eqn{d} is the event indicator.
#' The \code{MI_T} method is the same except that \eqn{\log (t)} is replaced by \eqn{t} in the imputation model.
#' The results are stored in long format.
#' @format A data frame with 3,000 rows and 4 variables:
#' * `dataset` Simulated dataset number.
#' * `method` Method used (`CC`, `MI_LOGT` or `MI_T`).
#' * `b` Point estimate.
#' * `se` Standard error of the point estimate.
#' @rdname MIsim

#' @title Example of a simulation study on survival modelling
#' @description A dataset from a simulation study assessing the impact of misspecifying the baseline hazard in survival models on regression coefficients.
#' One thousand datasets were simulated, each containing a binary treatment variable with a log-hazard ratio of -0.50.
#' Survival data was simulated for two different sample sizes, 50 and 250 individuals, and under two different baseline hazard functions, exponential and Weibull.
#' Consequently, a Cox model (Cox, 1972), a fully parametric exponential model, and a Royston-Parmar (Royston and Parmar, 2002) model with two degrees of freedom were fit to each simulated dataset.
#' See `vignette("B-relhaz", package = "rsimsum")` for more information.

#' * `dataset` Simulated dataset number.
#' * `n` Sample size of the simulate dataset.

#' * `model` Method used (`Cox`, `Exp`, or `RP(2)`).

#' @title Example of a simulation study on frailty survival models
#' @description A dataset from a simulation study comparing frailty flexible parametric models fitted using penalised likelihood to semiparametric frailty models.
#' Both models are fitted assuming a Gamma and a log-Normal frailty.
#' One thousand datasets were simulated, each containing a binary treatment variable with a log-hazard ratio of -0.50. Clustered survival data was simulated assuming 50 clusters of 50 individuals each, with a mixture Weibull baseline hazard function and a frailty following either a Gamma or a Log-Normal distribution.
#' The comparison involves estimates of the log-treatment effect, and estimates of heterogeneity (i.e. the estimated frailty variance).
#' @format A data frame with 16,000 rows and 6 variables:
#' * `i` Simulated dataset number.
#' * `b` Point estimate.
#' * `se` Standard error of the point estimate.
#' * `par` The estimand. `trt` is the log-treatment effect, `fv` is the variance of the frailty.
#' * `fv_dist` The true frailty distribution.
#' * `model` Method used (`Cox, Gamma`, `Cox, Log-Normal`, `RP(P), Gamma`, or `RP(P), Log-Normal`).
