Title: Analysis of Simulation Studies Including Monte Carlo Error
Description: Summarise results from simulation studies and compute Monte Carlo
  standard errors of commonly used summary statistics. This package is modelled 
  on the 'simsum' user-written command in 'Stata' (White I.R., 2010 
  <https://www.stata-journal.com/article.html?article=st0200>), further extending
  it with additional performance measures and functionality.
